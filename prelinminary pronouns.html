<h1>Statistical Analysis Report: Pronoun Usage and Pricing Strategies in Online Language Tutoring</h1>

<div class="abstract">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the relationship between pronoun usage patterns and hourly pricing among 651 online language tutors across two languages (English and Chinese) and both genders. Using correlation analysis, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests, we identify significant associations between first-person pronoun density and pricing strategies. Results indicate that reduced self-referential language correlates with higher pricing, suggesting linguistic markers of professional positioning. Gender and language differences are also explored, revealing systematic variation in pronoun usage across demographic groups.
</div>

<h2>1. Introduction and Variable Definitions</h2>

<p>This analysis investigates the linguistic strategies employed by online language tutors in their self-introductions, specifically examining pronoun usage as a potential indicator of professional positioning and pricing strategy. The dataset comprises 651 tutors offering English (n=327) and Chinese (n=324) language instruction.</p>

<h3>1.1 Key Variables</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Price_per_hour:</strong> Hourly rate in Hong Kong Dollars (HKD)</li>
    <li><strong>perthousand_all_pronouns:</strong> Total pronoun density per 1,000 words</li>
    <li><strong>first_pronoun_perthousand:</strong> First-person pronoun density (I, we, me, us)</li>
    <li><strong>pronoun_perthousand_second:</strong> Second-person pronoun density (you, your)</li>
    <li><strong>pronoun_first_perthousand_plur:</strong> Plural first-person pronouns (we, us)</li>
    <li><strong>pronoun_perthousand_sing:</strong> Singular first-person pronouns (I, me)</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Sample Composition</h3>

            <td>23.00 – 541.00</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>2. Descriptive Statistics and Distributional Properties</h2>

<p>Shapiro-Wilk normality tests reveal that pricing data significantly deviates from normality across all groups (p < 0.05), necessitating the use of both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. First-person pronoun densities generally follow normal distributions, while plural first-person and singular pronoun metrics show non-normal distributions, likely due to zero-inflation and right-skewness.</p>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> English tutors show substantially higher singular first-person pronoun usage (66-74 per 1,000 words) compared to Chinese tutors (1.3-1.4 per 1,000 words), likely reflecting language-specific grammatical conventions and cultural communication norms.
</div>

<h2>3. Correlation Analysis: Pronoun Usage and Pricing</h2>

<p>Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine linear relationships between pronoun metrics and hourly rates. The analysis reveals consistent negative correlations between first-person pronoun usage and pricing across most demographic groups, suggesting that tutors commanding higher rates employ less self-focused language.</p>

    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>3.2 Statistical Interpretation</h3>

<p><strong>First-Person Pronouns and Pricing:</strong> Across all groups, increased use of first-person pronouns (particularly singular forms) correlates negatively with pricing. For English female tutors, this relationship is most pronounced (r = -0.226, p = 0.0046), indicating that tutors charging higher rates use approximately 23% less "I/me" language per standard deviation increase in price. This pattern suggests that premium-priced tutors adopt more client-focused rather than self-focused communication styles.</p>

<p><strong>Second-Person Pronouns:</strong> English male tutors show a significant positive correlation between second-person pronoun usage and pricing (r = 0.237, p = 0.0019). This finding indicates that higher-priced male English tutors employ more "you"-focused language, emphasizing student engagement and personalization.</p>

<p><strong>Plural First-Person Pronouns:</strong> The positive correlation between "we/us" usage and pricing among English male tutors (r = 0.214, p = 0.0050) suggests that collaborative framing ("we will learn together") may be a pricing strategy among premium tutors.</p>

<h2>4. Between-Group Comparisons</h2>

<h3>4.1 Language Differences (ANOVA)</h3>

<p>One-way ANOVA reveals highly significant differences between English and Chinese tutors across multiple dimensions:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Variable</th>

            <td>English tutors use more pronouns overall</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>first_pronoun_perthousand</td>
            <td>38.591</td>
            <td class="sig-high">< 0.0001***</td>
            <td>English tutors use more first-person pronouns</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>pronoun_perthousand_sing</td>
            <td>3288.439</td>
            <td class="sig-high">< 0.0001***</td>
            <td>Extremely large language-specific difference</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The extraordinarily high F-statistic for singular first-person pronouns (F = 3288.44) reflects fundamental linguistic differences: English grammar requires explicit subject pronouns, while Chinese allows pro-drop (subject omission). This grammatical distinction accounts for the 50-fold difference in singular pronoun density between language groups.</p>

<h3>4.2 Gender Differences Within Languages</h3>

<p>Independent samples t-tests (with balanced samples of n=150 per gender) reveal significant gender effects within each language group:</p>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Female Chinese tutors charge significantly higher rates (16% premium, p = 0.0088) and use more pronouns overall. This gender pricing gap may reflect market positioning, experience levels, or perceived expertise differences.</p>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Male English tutors charge approximately 10% more than females (p = 0.0398), reversing the pattern observed among Chinese tutors. Female English tutors use significantly more first-person pronouns (12% higher, p = 0.0005), suggesting gender-differentiated communication styles within the English tutoring market.</p>

<h2>5. Discussion and Implications</h2>

<h3>5.1 Linguistic Markers of Professional Positioning</h3>

<p>The consistent negative correlation between first-person pronoun usage and pricing across demographic groups suggests that pronoun choice functions as a linguistic marker of professional positioning. Tutors commanding premium rates systematically reduce self-referential language, potentially signaling:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Client-centered orientation:</strong> Shifting focus from self-promotion to student needs</li>
    <li><strong>Professional authority:</strong> Reduced need for explicit self-justification</li>
    <li><strong>Objective expertise framing:</strong> Presenting qualifications as facts rather than personal claims</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Gender and Pricing Dynamics</h3>

<p>The opposing gender pricing gaps between Chinese (female premium) and English (male premium) tutoring markets warrant further investigation. Possible explanations include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Differential native speaker advantages by gender within each language market</li>
    <li>Cultural expectations regarding language teaching roles</li>
    <li>Self-selection into online tutoring platforms by gender and language</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Methodological Considerations</h3>

<p>Several limitations should be noted:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-sectional design:</strong> Causal relationships cannot be established</li>
    <li><strong>Self-selection bias:</strong> Tutors choose their own pricing and language</li>
    <li><strong>Platform effects:</strong> Data from a single tutoring platform may not generalize</li>
    <li><strong>Confounding variables:</strong> Experience, credentials, and ratings not controlled</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Conclusions</h2>

<p>This analysis provides robust statistical evidence that pronoun usage patterns correlate systematically with pricing strategies in online language tutoring. The negative association between first-person pronoun density and hourly rates suggests that linguistic self-presentation serves as a strategic tool for professional positioning. Gender and language differences further indicate that these patterns operate within culturally and linguistically specific contexts.</p>

<p>Future research should employ longitudinal designs to examine whether pronoun usage changes causally affect pricing success, and should incorporate additional covariates such as tutor experience, educational credentials, and student satisfaction ratings to isolate the independent effect of linguistic style on market outcomes.</p>
